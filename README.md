Mysqlgame Custom UI

This is a work in progress for the browser based game located at
mysqlgame.com


"public_html" holds the javascript pages you run in your browser

"mySQLGameUIchanges.js" is the reference material I am using which contains the websites code as well as the relevant
  parts of another UI system
  
"mySQLGameMyUIChanges.js" is my current UI system I am building
